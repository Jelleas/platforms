# macOS: Installing

To develop web apps you need some tools on you laptop. This guide helps you with installing al these tools.

We assume you're running the latest macOS, Catalina. Please ask if you're running an older version and can't upgrade.

    xcode-select --install

and click "Install".

Some useful development tools can be installed on Mac using [_Homebrew_](https://brew.sh/).

1. Open the terminal app (press `⌘-Space`, type **terminal** and press enter).

2. Run

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

to install Homebrew.

Good free code editors are: Free code editors are [Textmate](https://macromates.com/download), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). We would recommend Textmate, but you are free to choose another editor if you like.
