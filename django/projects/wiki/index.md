# Wiki

From now on, we require that you take your time to do a formal up-front design of what you are going to make for this project.

Your first to-do is to read the project specification in full and try to imagine what the website will look like. Then, with your partner, create a design document that describes **what** you are going to make and what it will look like. While doing this, there are also some technical challenges that you need to take into account as much as possible.

For this project, we would like you to take the items below as a guide for producing design documentation:

- The project comes with a number of files already. Say you are going to add a **new page**, what files should you change to make that work?

- An important part of the project is creating HTML files for some of the pages. Make a list of the HTML pages that you are going to need. Don't forget to add any pages that would be needed but aren't directly mentioned in the project requirements.

- The project requirements describe the application workflow, the steps that users can take to reach certain goals. Use the descriptions of the workflow to make a complete sketch of all pages, including all user interface elements, with lines pointing from buttons toward pages that those buttons lead to.

One brief introduction for that last item is the [Beginner's guide to UI sketching](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/ui-sketching/) at JustInMind. Read it well! Keep in mind that your sketches may be very simple, something like [this image](https://mcrubioux.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/appsketches1.png).

You should put your lists and sketches in a separate folder in your GitHub repository, so you can discuss these with your mentor before starting coding!
