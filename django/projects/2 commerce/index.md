# Commerce

## Getting Started

- [Watch Lecture 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/4/)
- Accept the assignment on [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZBMBwaa0)
- [Problem Specification](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

## Design Doc

Your first to-do is to read the project specification in full and try to imagine what the website will look like. Then, with your partner, create a design document that describes **what** you are going to make and what it will look like. While doing this, there are also some technical challenges that you need to take into account as much as possible.

For this project, we would like you to take the items below as a guide for producing design documentation:

- Think about the models you'll need, create a simple [Class Diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/) with all the models. You can do this on paper or user an online tool like [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).
- The information from the database is needed on different pages. Create a list of all database information needed for each page.

You should put your lists and sketches in a separate folder in your GitHub repository.
