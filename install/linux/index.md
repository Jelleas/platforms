# Linux: Installing

For those using Linux, install Git, Python 3 (3.6 or higher) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) using your package manager.

For example, Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install python3-pip ruby-sass

After you installed Pip, install Django using:

    pip install django
